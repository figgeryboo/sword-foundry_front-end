# Sword Foundry (Front-End)

####  Single Resource Solo Project - Bethany A. Torres 2023

***

I created this app to showcase the smiths and traders behind the heroes of fantasy and where they possibly might have gotten their swords of legend. Are these swords cursed? Are they rare? Do they have silly little names and funny makers? 

Yes. Yes, they do.
